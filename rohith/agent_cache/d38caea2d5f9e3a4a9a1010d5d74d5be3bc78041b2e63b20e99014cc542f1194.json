However, ongoing geopolitical supply chain risks (energy, semiconductors) and moderating consumer spending introduce volatility and sector-specific headwinds that warrant careful stock selection and risk management.\n\n*   **Fixed Income Markets:** Anticipation of Fed rate cuts should lead to a decline in longer-term yields, benefiting bond prices. However, the pace and magnitude of these cuts are highly dependent on inflation data, creating potential for yield volatility. Elevated geopolitical risks also maintain a baseline level of uncertainty that could support demand for safe-haven assets.\n\n*   **Overall Market Outlook:** The economy's resilience amidst higher rates, coupled with a potential Fed pivot, suggests a cautiously optimistic environment. Investors should remain attuned to inflation trends and geopolitical developments, as these will be key drivers of both equity performance and fixed income returns throughout the year."}
