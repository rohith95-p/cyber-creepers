However, ongoing geopolitical supply chain risks (energy, semiconductors) and moderating consumer spending introduce volatility and sector-specific headwinds. Investors should favor companies with pricing power and resilient demand.\n\n*   **Fixed Income Markets:** Anticipation of Fed rate cuts is likely to drive down longer-term yields, creating opportunities for capital appreciation in bonds. However, persistent inflation risks and geopolitical supply shocks could temper the pace of yield declines and introduce short-term volatility. Focus on duration management and credit quality.\n\n*   **Overall Market Outlook:** The economy's resilience amidst higher rates, coupled with a potential Fed pivot, suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook. However, the interplay of disinflationary progress, labor market cooling, and significant geopolitical supply risks necessitates a balanced approach, favoring assets that can navigate both growth and inflation uncertainty."}
