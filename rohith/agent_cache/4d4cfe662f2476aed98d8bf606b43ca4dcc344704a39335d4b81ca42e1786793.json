{"timestamp": "2026-02-22T05:02:28.098357", "result": "**Goal Progress Report**\n\nYour primary goal of general wealth building to $1,000,000 over the next 20 years is currently **on track** with a projected surplus of $1,105,066. The Monte Carlo simulation, based on your current portfolio of AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, and BND, indicates a median projected value of $2,105,066 after 20 years. This is significantly above your target, driven by an implied annual growth rate of 16.46%, which comfortably exceeds the 12.20% required to reach your goal.\n\nThe simulation also provides valuable insights into potential short-term volatility. While there's a 77.8% probability of a positive return in any given year, the range of outcomes highlights the importance of staying invested. For instance, the 5th percentile worst-case scenario shows a potential loss to $84,331 in the first year, underscoring that market fluctuations are a normal part of investing. However, the median path suggests consistent growth, and your current trajectory is very strong.\n\nTo maintain this positive momentum and further optimize your portfolio for your moderate risk tolerance, we recommend two specific actions. First, consider rebalancing your portfolio annually to ensure your allocation to individual technology stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN) does not exceed 60% of your total assets. This will help mitigate concentration risk. Second, we suggest increasing your annual savings by an additional $500 per month. While you are on track, this additional contribution will further enhance your wealth accumulation and provide an even larger buffer against unexpected market downturns.\n\nYour current investment strategy and savings are performing exceptionally well, placing you in an excellent position to achieve and even surpass your wealth-building objective. By continuing to adhere to a disciplined approach and implementing these targeted adjustments, you can confidently navigate the next two decades with a strong likelihood of significant financial success."}
