The Monte Carlo simulation indicates a significant shortfall, with a projected median portfolio value of just $3 after 15 years, leaving a gap of $1,999,997. While your current portfolio has a 77.8% probability of a positive return in any given year, the implied annual growth rate of -53.42% is far below the 14.87% required to reach your objective. This suggests that your current investment strategy and savings rate are not aligned with your ambitious retirement target.\n\nThe simulation's stark outcome highlights the need for a substantial adjustment. The current portfolio's performance, even with a moderate risk tolerance, is not generating the growth necessary to compound your initial $250,000 into $2,000,000 over the next 15 years. To bridge this gap, we need to implement strategies that significantly enhance both your portfolio's growth potential and your overall savings.\n\nTo address this, I recommend two key actions. First, we should rebalance your portfolio to increase its growth orientation while remaining within your moderate risk tolerance. This could involve a strategic shift towards a higher allocation in diversified equity ETFs that track broad market indices, such as the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) or the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), while potentially reducing the weighting in individual tech stocks. Second, and critically, we need to significantly increase your annual savings. Based on the required growth rate, a substantial increase in contributions will be essential. We can explore options such as maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, and potentially increasing contributions to a taxable brokerage account.\n\nWhile the current situation presents a significant challenge, it is not insurmountable. By taking decisive action now to adjust your investment strategy and increase your savings, we can significantly improve your trajectory towards your $2,000,000 retirement goal. We will work together to implement these changes and monitor your progress closely, ensuring we are on the most effective path to achieving your long-term financial security."}
